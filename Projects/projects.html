    <p>
      In this project we had to recreate an Amazon page. To do this I had to create a h1 tag and then create a paragraph under it with the links. This was the easy part, because creating those tags are as simple as writing the information down. The
      images were the hard part, because I needed to get them all to be aligned with a certain number of images on each line. I solved this by getting each image to be a certain width and height, but there are multiple other ways that this could
      have been solved.

    <p>This Project required us to recreate a Guthub page. This was a challenge because of the images at the bottom. The top part was fairly straight forward though. It was just typing in the text and then getting the text to appear in the middle of
      the screen. The bottom required a little bit more though. It required you put the image and paragraph in a section and then float it to the left to get both of them on the same line. The two sections also needed to be a width of 50% in order
      to get them both on the same line.

    <p>This project had me recrate a website of my choosing. I chose the above wiki for a game, because I thought I would have to most fun recreating a wiki for a game that I enjoyed. While this was a great learning experience, it was very
      challenging. I had to create bar at the top and side along with creating different sections in the body. While they seemed impossible at first, I slowly started to understand what I was doing and recreated it fairly well. To see the recreation
      that I made visit the link <a href="https://codepen.io/zceyakr/pen/rqeOvP" target="_blank">here</a> to my CodePen recreation of the wiki.
