    <h2>Growing Up</h2>
    <p>
      Hello, my name is Zackery Hitchcock and I grew up in a small town called Rome in Bradford County located in the northeastern part of Pennsylvania. From a young age I knew I wanted to work with computers for a living. As the years went on my
      mind changed from wanting to work on computers to me writing the code for webpages on computers. My love for this subject started with me going on to do some of these subjects in my school.
    </p>
    <h2>School Experience</h2>
    <p>
      Because I lived in a small area my school I went to was not always the most up to day on its electronics. Because of this my first experience with Tec related classes in high school. When I was in 9’th grade my school announced that it was
      starting a robotics program. While this was interesting to me I thought I would not be good enough for the course, so I decided not to take it. When my 10’th grade year came around I felt that there was no reason for me to not take this
      course, so I decided I would try it out. That was not the only Tec related course available though. That year was also the first year a video game and app design course was available, and I decided I would take that as well. That was the best
      choice that I made in my high school career. While There was not a whole lot that I took from these class, because it was the first time they were offered and the teachers themselves were still learning, it sparked my interest in the coding
      and programing environment.
    </p>
    <h2>College Experience</h2>
    <p>
      From this experience leads me to this day where I am currently in college at Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology where I am currently enrolled in their Computer Software Engineering Technology program. From Being enrolled here I have
      learned everything that I currently know. This includes everything from how to semantically write and create HTML to being able to now write CSS correctly and create webpages that look good enough that they look like normal web pages. This
      course is everything that I was hoping it would be to improve my coding ability. While there is much more information that I still need to learn, I am excited to learn more. My overall hope from this program is to eventually have the ability
      to create a game of my own someday.
