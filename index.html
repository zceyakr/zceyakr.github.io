    <h2>Growing Up</h2>
    <p>
      Hello, my name is Zackery Hitchcock and I grew up in a small town called Rome in Bradford County located in the northeastern part of Pennsylvania. Because I lived in a small town, there was not always a lot to do in my free time. This led me
      to me spending most of my free time playing video games and watching YouTube or just doing schoolwork.
    </p>
    <p>From a young age I knew I wanted to work with computers for a living. As the years went on my mind changed from wanting to work on computers to me now writing the code for webpages on computers. My love for this subject started with my high
      school years. When I was in 9’th grade my school announced that it was starting a robotics program. While this was interesting to me I thought I would not be good enough for the course, so I decided not to take it. When my 10’th grade year
      came around I felt that I was finally ready to take this course. Not only was this course available, but it was also the first year a video game and app design course available and I decided I would take that as well. This was the best choice
      that I made in my high school career. While There was not a whole lot that I took from these class, because it was the first time they were offered and the teachers themselves were still learning, it sparked my interest in the coding
      environment.
    </p>

    <p> From this experience leads me to this day where I am currently in college at Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology where I am currently enrolled in their Computer Software Engineering Technology program. From Being enrolled here I have
      learned everything that I currently know. I have learned everything from how to semantically write and create HTML to being able to now write CSS correctly and create webpages that look good enough that they look like normal web pages. What I
      am excited to learn in this program is the ability to create a game of my own someday.
