    <h2>What I Do</h2>
    <p>
      My personal interests include me playing video games. I play a variety of video games in my spare time. The genera of games that I play is FPS(Frist Person Shooter), Platformers(games where you have to travel around via jumping on platforms),
      Bullet Hell(games where the screen is almost completely filled with enemy projectiles and you have to try to avoid them without getting hit), roguelike games(games where you are traveling through procedurally generated worlds where you only
      have one life), and dungeon crawlers(where the player has to travel through the labyrinth and kill various types of monsters).
    </p>
    <h2>Games</h2>
    <p>
      Some of my favorite games to play include games like:

          <h3 id="enter">Enter the Gungeon</h3>

          <li>
            <p>Enter the Gungeon is a gun-themed game all about trying to fight your way through a dungeon that is ever increasing in difficulty as you complete each floor. The main objective is to get to the last floor and kill the boss to be
              able to complete the dungeon. You do this by fighting through a variety of different bullet themed enemies using various types of guns. An example of how unique these weapons/enemies are is the fact that you could have a gun that
              shoots guns that shoots the enemy that is shaped like a bullet. This is just one example of how unique this game’s graphic design is. For more information about this game check out the game at its official website <a href="http://www.enterthegungeon.com"

              There are many different types of Call of Duty’s out there to choose from and because I like and play them all, I am talking about all Call of Duty games. Call of Duty is a game where you and your team are working together to fight
              through a war and come out the victor. When playing this game there are many different types of game modes that you could play. A few of them for example are the standard Team Deathmatch where both teams fight until a one team has a
              certain amount of kills, Domination where both teams fight to capture 3 different locations around the map and defend them from letting the enemy capture them, and there is also Search and Destroy where one team is fighting to plant a
              bomb at a certain site and blow it up and the other team is trying to stop them. You can visit Call of Duty’s official website <a href="http://www.callofduty.com" target="_blank">here</a> where you can find out about news and
              upcoming events.

          Minecraft is game where you have to survive in the wilderness from all of the monsters that want to kill you. This is done by gathering recourses and building a structure to protect yourself from the monsters. In order to gather recourses,
          you have to build tools such as a pickaxe, axe, shovel. These recourses are fund underground in caves where they can be mined up and then later smelted down into the ingot form and then usable to craft useful items for your survival. Other
          that just surviving from night to night, there is also a boss that you can fight. This boss is a dragon that will try in all of its power to kill you. Even after you kill the dragon you can choose to playing in order to create massive
          beautiful creations to your heart’s desire. The main reason why this game is so nice to play is that there is endless possibilities to create anything you want. You can visit the official Minecraft website <a href="http://www.minecraft.net"
